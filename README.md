# Confidence-Driven Inference Tutorial

## What this tutorial does
The Jupyter notebook walks you through an **end-to-end, automated human-AI annotation pipeline** based on **Confidence-Driven Inference (CDI)**. We collect human annotations via **Prolific** or **Amazon Mechanical Turk**, and LLM annotations through **OpenAI**'s API. The example is based on the method introduced in:

The goal is to estimate a target statistic about a text corpus while **minimizing costly human labels** by:

1. **Obtaining cheap-but-noisy labels from an LLM** together with its confidence scores.  
2. **Collecting a small sample of human labels** to calibrate.  
3. **Iteratively sampling the most informative texts** for additional human annotation using the CDI sampling rule.  
4. **Computing the final point estimate & bootstrap confidence interval** once the annotation budget is exhausted.

We focus on annotating texts for **politeness** and showcase the estimation of **two target statistics**:
1. $mean(H)$: prevalence of politeness, i.e., the fraction of texts in the corpus that are polite.
2. $\beta_{hedge}$: the impact of linguistic features of hedging ($X$) on the perceived politeness ($H$), estimated with a logistic regression.

Although the example focuses on detecting *politeness* and estimating these two target statistics, you can adapt the flow to any text classification task and any other target statistic.

## Notebook outline

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Import libraries** | Loads scientific stack (`numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `tqdm`, Qualtrics/Prolific/MTURK helpers, and `openai` for LLM calls). |
| **Parameter blocks** | Separate cells let you tune *CDI hyper-parameters*, *LLM sampling settings*, and *human‑annotation settings* (batch size, budget, etc.). |
| **Step&nbsp;1 – LLM annotation** | Loads a CSV of raw texts (`data/politeness_dataset.csv`), queries the LLM for a label & confidence for each row, and stores results in the working `data` frame. |
| **Step&nbsp;2 – Initial human labels** | Publishes the first batch of texts to Prolific or MTURK, waits for responses, and merges them back into `data`. Initialize the sampling rule to obtain per‑item selection probabilities. |
| **Step&nbsp;3 – Iterative sampling loop** | For each batch: choose texts with highest CDI scores → post new survey → ingest responses → update CDI state. |
| **Step&nbsp;4 – Estimation** | After the last batch, calculate the CDI estimator and a bootstrap 90 % confidence interval. Timing information for the whole pipeline is also logged. |

## Tutorial Notebooks

This repository includes five versions of a tutorial:

1. **`tutorial_version_1_adaptive.ipynb`**  
   Adaptive label collection using high-level functions and pre-collected human labels (for demonstration purposes).

2. **`tutorial_version_2_non-adaptive.ipynb`**  
   Non-adaptive label collection on a random sample of texts, using pre-collected human labels.

---

## Requirements & setup

1. **Python ≥ 3.9**  
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run

```bash
jupyter notebook
# open tutorial.ipynb and run cells top‑to‑bottom
```

- **Dry‑run mode:** Keep `COLLECT_LLM = False` and `COLLECT_HUMAN = False` in the parameter cells to skip external API calls while you familiarize yourself with the flow.  

---

## Expected outputs

- Console log showing batch progression and total wall‑clock time.  
- Printed estimate and 90 % CI for the target metric.

---

## Adapting the tutorial

- Swap in your own dataset with **`Text`** and **feature column(s)**.  
- Update the `mapping_categories` dict to match your label set.  
- Tweak `burnin_steps`, `batch_size`, and `budget` to suit annotation cost constraints.  
- Plug in a different LLM prompt or model name to target alternative tasks.
